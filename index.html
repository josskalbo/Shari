                Heyyy, Shari. It's your special day! I just want to say that I am so happy we met. Now we're friends, and I'm much happier. I want to know you more, and I want you to know more about me. I know that takes time, but we'll take our time because we're still young, wild, and free~ HAHAHAHA.
                
                I'm not very good with words, so I'll keep this short. You are very important to me, Shari. Because of you, I realized that I'm full of flaws—so much so that I think I'm an effing loser LOL—but still, you remained my friend, and I'm very thankful for that. I want to become a kinder and better person for you, Shari! And I hope you will support me through my journey. HAHAHA, ka hilas lol.
                
                Please don't change, and sana magbago ka na HAHAHAHA. Love lots! <333
